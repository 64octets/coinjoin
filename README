RUNNING:

to run the client install Python PyQt4, and sx (see http://sx.dyne.org)

  # apt-get install python-pyqt4
  # wget http://sx.dyne.org/install-sx.sh
  # bash install-sx.sh

then run it:

  $ python client.py

TECHICAL INFO:

 - client is pyqt + sx
 - server is gevent + flask + sx

Client and server speak a json protocol where a room is created
for each url of the form:

   <server>/g/<room_name>

or

   <server>/g/<room_name>/<participants>

so a sample url would be:

   http://7vxb75tbnszhy2go.onion/g/goy7yeiXopethi

The first time a url is accessed with GET the room gets created
and starts collecting information.

Rooms go through several states or stages, one at a time:
 * outputs: Collecting outputs
 * inputs: Collecting inputs
 * signatures: Collecting signatures
 * final: final tx available (and broadcasted)

In each stage each client has to send their specific argument, after
collecting inputs and outputs a tx for signing is generated and each
client signs their own, finally the server mixes the result into the
final tx.

Clients send their input through POST to the room url:

POST parameters:
 - input: send our client input (only allowed in inputs stage)
 - output: send our client output (only allowed in outputs stage)
 - sig: send out signature (only allowed in signature stage)
